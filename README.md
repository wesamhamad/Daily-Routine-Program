# Daily Routine Program 
A project for CS181 course, presented to Dr. Abeer Alhujaylan, the software development process of a Daily Routine Program .

## Project idea
The projectis based on team work, each group consists of 4 students each student will program a part then we integrated it  as one program, parts of project are :

1.Study Time:
   * Design a schedule that helps you to study for five hours a day. Each day you will study five courses, starting from Sunday till Saturday. Also, the code answer you‚Äôre inquiries about the course that will be studied according to the specific day and time in each time you want to know. 

2.Sport time: 
   * Design a program that helps you finish daily user-defined steps. If you finish your daily steps, the program will print: ‚ÄúWow, you did a great job!‚Äù. If you have not finished your steps, the program will print: ‚ÄúOoops, you have not finished your daily steps! try tomorrow‚Äù. 
   
3.Play time: 
   * After you finished your study and your daily exercise, you deserve some fun before you go to bed. Let's play the game: "Whoever reaches 20 first is a winner!" The rules of the game are as follows: 
       * The computer randomly determines who starts playing first.‚Ä®o The computer randomly determines whether you are allowed to use one or two 
numbers.
       * The player who reaches the number 20 is the winner and is congratulated by typing 
the following sentence: ‚ÄúCongratulations! The first / second player is the winner!‚Äù   
       
4.Creative time 

   * I think of an idea for a program which is reminder and to do list that‚Äôs help us to plan our day and at the end we check what we have finished .

#### The concept of the program is :
* In each part of the code which represent a part of the day, I call the function reminder and send my_clock(currentTime) as an argument :
``` c
reminder(my_clock(4));
```
* Then base on the time send it's will decide which alarm will be alaret with a timer, timer done by help of recursion concept  :
```c
void timer(int count[], int index, int size ){
    if (index <=size) {
        timer(count,index +1, size);
        if(index <10){
            printf("%55s","");
            printf("00:0%d:00 \n",count[index]);
        }
        else if(index>=10){
            printf("%55s","");
            printf("00:%d:00 \n",count[index]);
        }

    }
}
```
* At the end of program (which represent end of the day),function to_do_list() is called to ask user which task he have finished :

```c
void to_do_list(){
    char *to_do[6]={"Computer Program ‚úÖ","Math‚úÖ ","Physics ‚úÖ","Information Technology ‚úÖ","Arab ‚úÖ","walk ‚úÖ"};
    char *done[6]={"","","","","",""};
    int did ,checked=0;
    printf ("\n%30cWhich of the following did you finish enter their numbers? \n", ' ');
    printf ("%40c0 >> Computer Program 1 >> Math 2 >> Physics \n"
            "%40c3 >> Information Technology 4 >> Arab 5 >> walk\n %50c >>> to end enter -1 <<<\n",  ' ', ' ',' ');
    scanf("%d",&did);
    while(did!=-1) {
        done[did]=to_do[did];
        scanf("%d",&did);
    }
    puts("My-checklist üì∞ ‚úÖ :");
    for (int j =0; j<6 ;j++) {
        if (strcmp(done[j],"") == 0)
            continue;
        printf("%s\n",done[j]);
        checked++;
        }
    if(checked==6){
        puts("\nYou did a great job today ! ");
    }
    else if(checked==0)
        puts("Ops!you didn't finish any thing today \n you have to try it better tomorrow ");
}
```
``
Note: above to do list code done by help of Array of pointers instead of using 2D array which take more space in (Dynamic-1D consumes less memory than the 2D).
